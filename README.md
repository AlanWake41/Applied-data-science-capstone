# Space-X-Falcon-9-First-Stage-Landing-Prediction
In this Project I predicted and visualised the landing possibility of
SpaceX Rockets with the help of past datas. Webscraping helped
to extract the data and Data Visualisation was done by Matplotlib
and Plotly. And Machine Learning Helped to predict Data Efficiently
with up to 80% Accuracy
